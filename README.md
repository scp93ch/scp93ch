## My Software

I have a few jobs, one of which involves software.

### Morse Code World

I am self-employed, developing [Morse code software and training tools](https://morsecode.world). My underlying software library for translating, creating, and decoding Morse code is actually available [on a different site](https://gitlab.com/scphillips/morse-pro).

### Previously: University of Southampton / Spyderisk

Until 2025 I was a principal enterprise fellow at the University of Southampton, in the school of Electronics and Computer Science. I worked on applied IT, particularly in the area of cyber-security. I led the development team for [Spyderisk](https://github.com/spyderisk) which is an open source semi-automated risk analysis tool, particularly suited to cyber-security.
