## My Software

I have a few jobs, two of which involve software.

### University of Southampton / Spyderisk

I am a principal enterprise fellow at the University of Southampton, in the school of Electronics and Computer Science. I work on applied IT, particularly in the area of cyber-security. I lead the development team for [Spyderisk](https://github.com/spyderisk) which is an open source semi-automated risk analysis tool, particularly suited to cyber-security.

### Morse Code World

I am self-employed, developing [Morse code software and training tools](https://morsecode.world). My underlying software library for translating, creating, and decoding Morse code is actually available [on a different site](https://gitlab.com/scphillips/morse-pro).
